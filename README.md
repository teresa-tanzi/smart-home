# smart-home
Project for my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science for New Media Communication, 2018

This repository contains the code I wrote to develop a prototype of an infrastructure composed by a smart-home, an untrusted cloud and a medical application. The data acquired by the smart-home need to be stored in the cloud preserving the confidentiality but also allowing the execution of a basic set of queries. I've contributed in the development of the smart-home gateway (in charge of encrypting the data) and the server side of the medical application (in charge of translating queries and answers). I've not included in the repository all the code I wasn't involved in writing, i.e. the data acquisition and the client side of the medical application.

The repository contains the following files:
- flat_type.py, insert_in_db.py and insert_in_db_clear.py: implementation of the smart-home gateway.
- server.py: server side of the medical application.
- cost_analysis.py and cost_analysis_2.py: analysis and comparisons between different solutions.
- functions.py: set of utility functions.
- read_me.txt: example of JSON query generated by the client of the medical application.
- Presentazione_Teresa_Tanzi.pdf: presentation I used to expose my thesis to the commission.
